2. Generating a Configuration File
==================================

This appendix includes a listing of all AMPS configuration parameters.
AMPS provides a command line option to help an administrator quickly set
up an AMPS server. In addition to the quick setup discussed in the
|userguide-getting-started|, AMPS also provides
the following command line options to create a basic XML configuration
file. Running the following command will create a configuration file
named ``config.xml``. The generated file is a bare-bones configuration
that allows AMPS to start, process JSON messages, and provide monitoring
through the admin interface.

.. code::

    ampServer --sample-config > config.xml

The AMPS server also provides the ability to perform basic validation of
the config file, using the ``--verify-config`` flag.

.. code::

    ampServer --verify-config config.xml

The validation process checks for errors in the configuration that would
prevent AMPS from starting, and reports warnings and informational
messages about the configuration file. However, the validation process
does not ensure that the configuration file provided is suitable for any
particular purpose.

When a configuration file uses the ``Include`` directive or uses environment
variable substitution, it can be useful to produce a fully expanded file. AMPS
provides a ``--dump-config`` flag for this purpose. The command produces the
fully expanded file to standard output.

.. code::

    ampServer --dump-config config.xml  > expanded.xml
