14. Actions
=============

AMPS includes the ability to perform administrative tasks in response to
Linux signals or on a set schedule. The ``Actions`` element allows you
to specify these actions and when they occur.

The ``Actions`` element contains one or more ``Action`` elements. An
``Action`` element contains an ``On`` element, which tells AMPS when to
perform the task, and a ``Do`` element, which tells AMPS what task to
perform.
