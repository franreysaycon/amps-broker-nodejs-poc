1. Introduction to 60East Technologies AMPS
============================================

Thank you for choosing the Advanced Message Processing System (AMPS)
from 60East Technologies. AMPS is more than a publish and subscribe
system. It is a feature-rich platform that enables you to easily build
data intensive applications that provide previously unattainable low
latency and high performance. AMPS combines a set of capabilities that
cut across traditional component divisions. 60East designed the
capabilities based on the needs of some of the most demanding
data-intensive applications on the planet, and engineered the
capabilities to work together seamlessly and provide the kind of
performance and latency that those applications demand.
