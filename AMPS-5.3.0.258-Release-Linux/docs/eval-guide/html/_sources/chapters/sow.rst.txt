4. State of the World (SOW) 
============================

.. index:: State of the World (SOW), SOW, AMPS; state, Last value cache,
   Caching, storage,

One of the core features of AMPS is the ability to persist the most
recent update for each message matching a topic. The State of the World
can be thought of as a database where messages published to AMPS are
filtered into topics, and where the topics store the latest update to a
message. Since AMPS subscriptions are based on the combination of topics
and filters, the State of the World (SOW) gives subscribers the ability
to quickly resolve any differences between their data and updated data
in the SOW by querying the current state of a topic, or a set of
messages inside a topic.
