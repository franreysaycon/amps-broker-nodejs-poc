6. Next Steps
==============

Now that you understand the basics of how AMPS works, you have two
potential paths forward in your usage of the product:

-  On one path, you may want to learn how to configure, deploy, and
   administer your own instance of AMPS. For this path, see the *User
   Guide*, which provides complete information for system administrators
   who are responsible for the deployment, availability and management
   of data to other users.

-  Alternatively, you may need to develop an application to work with
   AMPS, using one of the Developer Guides for Java, Python, C++, or C#.
   For this path, download one of the evaluation kits from the AMPS
   developer page at http://www.crankuptheamps.com/developer.

The following sections provide more information about each of these
paths and also briefly describes some use cases for AMPS.

Operation and Deployment
--------------------------

In preparing to deploy your instance of AMPS, you must size your host
environment according to multiple dimensions: memory, storage, CPU, and
network. The “Operation and Deployment” chapter in the *AMPS User Guide*
provides guidelines and best practices for configuring the host
environment. The chapter also specifies recommended settings for running
AMPS on a Linux operating system.

Application Development
-----------------------

Each language-specific *Development Guide* explains how to install,
configure, and develop applications that use AMPS. In order to develop
applications using an AMPS client, you must understand the basic
concepts of AMPS, such as *topics*, *subscriptions*, *messages* and
*SOW*.

You will also need an installed and running AMPS server to use the
product. Although you can type and compile programs that use AMPS
without a running server, you will get the most benefit by running the
programs against a working server. An evaluation version of AMPS is
available from http://www.crankuptheamps.com/evaluate.
