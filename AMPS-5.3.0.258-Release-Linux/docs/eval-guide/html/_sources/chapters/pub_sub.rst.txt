AMPS is a publish and subscribe message delivery system, which routes
messages from publishers to subscribers. “Pub/Sub” systems, as they are
often called, are a key part of most enterprise message buses, where
publishers broadcast messages without necessarily knowing all of the
subscribers that will receive them. This decoupling of the publishers
from the subscribers allows maximum flexibility when adding new data
sources or consumers.

**Figure 3.1:** *Publish and Subscribe*

AMPS can route messages from publishers to subscribers using a topic identifier and/or content within the 
message's payload. For example, in
:ref:`Figure 3.1<#pub_sub-fig1>`, 
there is a Publisher sending AMPS a message pertaining to the ``LN_ORDERS`` topic. The message being sent 
contains information on Ticker “IBM” with a Price of 125, both of these properties are contained within the 
message payload itself (i.e., the message content). AMPS routes the message to Subscriber 1 because it is
subscribing to all messages on the ``LN_ORDERS`` topic. Similarly, AMPS
routes the message to Subscriber 2 because it is subscribed to any
messages having the Ticker equal to “IBM”. Subscriber 3 is looking for a
different Ticker value and is not sent the message.
